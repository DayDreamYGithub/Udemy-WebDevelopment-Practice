This project followed the instructions of Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024 course on Udemy.
It is a simple number guessing game made with JavaScript. Initially, a prompt will ask you to input a maximum number. Then, the game will generate a random integer within this maximum range. You will need to input a number as your guess to check if it matches the randomly generated integer. If your guess is incorrect, the prompt will inform you whether your guess is too low or too high and will ask you to input again until you get the correct answer. You can view the result in the console or press 'q' to quit.
